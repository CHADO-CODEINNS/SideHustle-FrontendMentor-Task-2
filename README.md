## Overview
This is my solution to the second task given during the SIDEHUSTLE NG internship through FrontEnd Mentor. Quite exhausting...>--<

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Live Site URL: [NETLIFY](https://fylo-sidehustle.netlify.app)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
